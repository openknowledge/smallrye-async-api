= SmallRye AsyncAPI Spec

This specification aims at providing a unified Java API for the link:++https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0++[AsyncAPI v2 specification],
that all application developers can use to expose their API documentation.

* The link:++api/src/main/java/io/smallrye/asyncapi/spec/++[spec APIs] are composed of annotations, models, and programming interfaces.
* The link:++doc/src/docs/asciidoc/asyncapi-spec.adoc++[spec documentation] outlines the rules and boundaries of the spec.
* Generate AsyncAPI Code link:++https://modeling-languages.com/asyncapi-modeling-editor-code-generator/++[asyncapi modeling editor code generator]
