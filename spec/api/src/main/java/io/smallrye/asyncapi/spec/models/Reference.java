     * definition in the components section of the current AsyncAPI document. For example the schema of a request body may be
     * #/components/schemas/Payload or the definition of a parameter could be #/components/parameters/Routing.HostName.

     * If you provide a short name then the name will automatically be expanded to the appropriate full reference string. A
     * short name is a
     * string which is not a JSON pointer in that it does not contain a "/".
     *

     * "#/components/parameters/" to create "#/components/parameters/ShortName".
     * 
     * <pre>
     * <code>parameter.setRef("ShortName"); // #/components/parameters/ShortName</code>

     * <code>response.setRef("NotFound"); // #/components/responses/NotFound</code>

     * exclusive. If
     * other properties are defined in addition to the reference property then the result is undefined.
